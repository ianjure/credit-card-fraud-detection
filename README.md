# Credit Card Fraud Detection &nbsp; [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/ianjure/credit-card-fraud-detection/blob/main/Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection_Notebook.ipynb)
Credit card companies need to identify fraudulent transactions to prevent customers from being charged for items they did not purchase. The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model to predict whether a transaction is fraudulent. By training various classification algorithms, we aim to determine which model performs best for this task.

## Data Overview
We will use the **[Credit Card Transactions](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)** dataset from **Kaggle**, which includes transactions made by European cardholders in September 2013. The dataset covers transactions over two days, with 492 out of 284,807 transactions identified as fraudulent. It is highly imbalanced, and due to confidentiality concerns, most of the features are anonymized.

## Project Method
1. **Explore the Data:** Analyze the data statistically and check for null values.
2. **Train the Models:** Fit the data to various training algorithms.
3. **Evaluate the Models:** Assess model accuracy to identify the top-performing algorithm.

## Next Steps
* **Train** additional classification models and ensembles.
* **Fine-tune** the best-performing model.
