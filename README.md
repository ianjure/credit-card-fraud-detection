# Credit Card Fraud Detection
Credit card companies must identify fraudulent credit card transactions to prevent charging customers for items they did not purchase. The goal of this project is to create a machine learning model to predict whether a transaction is fraudulent or not. By training a bunch of classification algorithms, we will find out which model will perform the best for this task.

## Data Overview
We will be using the **[Credit Card Transactions](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)** dataset from **Kaggle**. This dataset contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders.
It presents transactions that occurred in two days, where 492 out of 284,807 transactions are fraudulent. The dataset is highly unbalanced, and due to confidentiality issues, most of the features are not named.

## Project Method
1. **Explore the Data:** Describe the data statistically and check for null values.
2. **Train the Models:** Fit the data to the training algorithms.
3. **Evaluate the Models:** Test model accuracies and find the top-performing one.

## Next Steps
1. **Try** out more classification models and ensembles.
2. **Fine-tune** the best-performing model.
