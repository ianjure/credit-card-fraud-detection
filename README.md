# Credit Card Fraud Detection
Let's go back to 1912 and explore the data behind the **Titanic** tragedy. The goal of this project is to create a machine learning model to predict if a passenger will survive the incident. We will utilize classification algorithms and processed data to find the best model. After that, we will create a web application that anyone can use to try and test our model with new data inputs.

## Data Overview
**Dataset:** [Credit Card Transactions](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)

We will be using the **Credit Card Transactions** dataset from **Kaggle**. This dataset contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders.
It presents transactions that occurred in two days, where 492 out of 284,807 transactions are fraudulent. The dataset is highly unbalanced, and due to confidentiality issues, most of the features are not named.

## Project Method
1. **Clean the Data:** Handle missing values, create new features, and process categorical variables.
2. **Explore the Data:** Find meaningful insights and relationships among the variables.
3. **Build the Model:** Train the algorithms and fine-tune the best model.
4. **Deploy the Model:** Build a Streamlit web application to test new data.

## Next Steps
1. Improve the **quality** of the data by creating new and relevant features.
2. Try more **sophisticated** classification models and tuning methods.
